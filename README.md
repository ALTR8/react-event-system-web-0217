# React Event System

## Objectives

1. Explain how React events differ from browser events
2. Describe how React standardizes events for compatibility
3. Describe the trade-offs of the React event system

## Overview

Introduce students to React Synthetic Events, especially the big ones like
form events, mouse events, and keyboard events.

Highlight event reuse (practical upshot: we need to log out the event, and can't
inspect it in console without doing so).

Don't worry about going too deep; there are a few lessons to cover all of this
stuff.
